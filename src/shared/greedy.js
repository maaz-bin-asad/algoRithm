            detail: "The motive of this problem is to find subarray from a given array such that it contains the elements of the given array such that difference between any two numbers is zero or one. Note that there may be other similar sub arrays but we need the smallest one. The logic is first sort the array and then create a new array which contains count of every element from the super array and the index being each element itself.At last we iterate through a new array from starting and start adding two elements one by one and keep track of lowest sum we are getting from those elements and output the final result",
